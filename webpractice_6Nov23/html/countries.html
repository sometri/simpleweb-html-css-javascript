      <h3> The Cultural Landscape Foundation (TCLF) is a non-profit organization dedicated to connecting people to places and preserving our shared landscape heritage. Founded in 1998, TCLF has four core programs:</h3>  
      <p> > What's Out There速 is North America's largest and most exhaustive database of cultural landscapes. It includes information on over 20,000 sites, including parks, gardens, cemeteries, and streetscapes. The database is a valuable tool for researchers, students, and the general public.</P> 
      <p> > Pioneers of American Landscape Design速 is an in-depth multimedia library of video oral histories of significant landscape architects and educators. The library includes interviews with over 100 individuals, and it is a valuable resource for anyone interested in the history of American landscape design.
      </P>  
      <p> > Landslide速 is an ongoing collection of important landscapes and landscape features that are threatened with destruction. The Landslide program raises awareness of these threatened landscapes and encourages their preservation.</P>  
      <p> > The Cornelia Hahn Oberlander International Landscape Architecture Prize速 is a biennial prize in landscape architecture that includes a US$100,000 monetary award and two years of public engagement activities. The prize is awarded to a landscape architect who has made significant contributions to the field.</P>
      <p> > TCLF is a valuable resource for anyone interested in landscape architecture, history, and preservation. The organization's programs help to connect people to places, identify the value of our shared landscape heritage, and empower its stewards.</P>
