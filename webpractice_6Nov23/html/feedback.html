      <h1>Feedback to us</h1>
      <h2>Your idea appreciated us</h2>   
      <p>As a general assistant, I understand that you need assistance in creating a feedback form template for your university. The feedback form should consist of Academic Affairs common questions, school/college and department questions, as well as individual instructor questions if applicable.
      </p>
      <p>It is important to ensure that the questions being asked are ones to which students can reasonably respond and that the emphasis is taken off the instructor and reframed to focus on students' engagement in their own learning and specific course/instructional elements. 
      </p>
      <p>The following are examples of questions that could be included in the feedback form template: 
      </p>
      <p>Academic Affairs Common Questions: - What were the primary reasons you took this course? - For this course, on average, how much time did you spend outside of synchronous or in-person class sessions on course work? - Did you feel that you performed to your potential in this course? - Was the syllabus an accurate guide to course requirements? - Were student participation and the contribution of ideas, comments, and questions encouraged? - Did the course assessments allow you to demonstrate what you learned? - Did you receive helpful feedback from the instructor to guide your progress in this course? 
      </p>
      <p>School/College and Department Questions: - Required for major, minor, or program? - Fulfilled Liberal Arts requirement/distribution (undergraduate only)? - Reputation of the instructor? - Fit into my schedule? - Advisor recommended course? - Friend(s) recommended course? 
      </p>
      <p>Open-Ended Question: - Would you like to provide any other comments about this course? - What would you like to say about this course to a student who is considering taking it in the future? 
      </p>
      <p>I hope this feedback form template assists you in creating a comprehensive and effective feedback system for your university. As a focused, smart, and resourceful assistant, please let me know if you require any further assistance.
